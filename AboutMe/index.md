Hello! My name is Jason and I am a PhD candidate in Dr. Andrea Lucky's lab at University of Florida. I grew up just outside of Baltimore, Maryland and have lived in Gainesville, Florida since August 2016.

# Hobbies

Collecting and curating insects is front and center in my life as both a hobby and part of my professional career as an entomologist. Ever since I was a kid, one of my favorite things to do was to observe and catalog the natural world, especially the incredible diversity of insects found all around us. I spent much of my childhood exploring the woods around my house, flipping rocks and logs, and getting dirty looking for something new. Though I have always been fascinated with all sorts of insects, I started really focusing on ants specifically when I began my M.S. in 2013.
