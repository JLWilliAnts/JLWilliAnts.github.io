Hello! My name is Jason and I am a PhD candidate in Dr. Andrea Lucky's lab at University of Florida. I grew up just outside of Baltimore, Maryland and have lived in Gainesville, Florida with my spouse and two cats since August 2016.

# Hobbies

**I am a collector of hobbies and lover of travel.** I enjoy exploring new activities and places, and I thrive most when offered creative freedom and fresh experiences.

I am and always have been a taxonomist at heart. **Collecting and curating insects** is front and center in my life as both a hobby and part of my professional career as an entomologist. Ever since I was a kid, one of my favorite things to do was to observe and catalog the natural world, especially the incredible diversity of insects. I spent much of my childhood exploring the woods around my house, flipping rocks and logs, and getting dirty looking for something new. Though I have always been fascinated with all sorts of insects, I started focusing on ants specifically when I began my M.S. in 2013.

Nowadays, in addition to collecting supplies, I sometimes also take a camera into the field because **I am an amateur photographer**. I don't have a whole lot of fancy equipment, but I got my first and only DSLR in 2009. Perhaps someday soon I will invest in new equipment.

When I am not outdoors or working, I also enjoy spending my free time **playing tabletop and video games**. 

I am also a **tech geek** and cannot resist powerful computers and fancy gadgets.

More to come...
