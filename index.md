## Academic Overview

### Research Interests

My research focus is ant taxonomy and systematics. I am currently resolving difficult taxonomic and evolutionary questions involving the global radiation of the genus Nylanderia, which includes over 130 described species across the globe and hundreds more unknown to science. Nylanderia species are among the most common ants worldwide and more than a dozen of them may threaten biodiversity, human productivity, and health as exotic or invasive pests. My training began with museum collections-based research and analysis of morphological data. I have since integrated other tools into my skillset, including genome-scale molecular phylogenetics, bioinformatics, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT).
