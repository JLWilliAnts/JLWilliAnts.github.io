## Academic Overview

### Research Interests

My research focus is ant taxonomy and systematics. I am currently resolving difficult taxonomic and evolutionary questions involving the global radiation of the genus *Nylanderia*, which includes over 130 described species across the globe and hundreds more unknown to science. *Nylanderia* species are among the most common ants worldwide and more than a dozen of them may threaten biodiversity, human productivity, and health as exotic or invasive pests. My training began with museum collections-based research and analysis of morphological data. I have since integrated other tools into my skillset, including genome-scale molecular phylogenetics, bioinformatics, and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) to build three-dimensional models of specimens for geometric morphometric analysis.
